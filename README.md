# todolive

A new Flutter project.

# Summary of “ToDolive” App Using Flutter, SQLite, and Cubit
Introduction:
In this project, I developed a “Todo” application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. I used the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework to build the app. Additionally, I utilized the local SQLite database to store tasks.

## Key Features:
Add New Task: Users can add new tasks using the add button.
Task Updates: Users can update task status (completed or not) by checking the checkbox.
View Tasks: Users can view all saved tasks.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks by swiping the card horizontally.
## Architectural Design:
I used the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern to manage the app’s state.
The Cubit library was employed to implement the BLoC architecture.
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations were performed on the local database using SQFlite.
